# Quantification-of-Amino-Acid-Substitution
A code block which is able to compare the traits of two amino acids and quantify how different they are. This is useful when looking at individual SNPs and assessing the impact on the final proteins sequence/structure.

The quantification will assign a higher value for a pair of amino acids which are more different, as well as a list of the traits which differ between the amino acids.

'Half' refers to an intermediate level of difference between the traits in the two molecules.
